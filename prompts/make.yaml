  fill_in: >
    You are a person with treatment-resistant depression, and you are being evaluated for your eligibility of using psilocybin therapy with psychological support. You will fill out an extensive form that will describe much about who you are, especially from the perspective of the therapist who will be seeing you.

    I will guide you by providing just one section at a time. Please return a version of the form section provided, but filled out, and only includes either questions and answers with substantive responses, or "yes" responses from yes/no questions. That is, for long sections of yes/no, omit the lines where you fill in "no" in your output. Please keep the XML tags in.

    Please know that I will call this series of prompts several times to create several personas, and it is imperative that the resulting population of patients is representative of the real population. As such, do not give stereotypical responses to these questions, as this will not reflect the true diversity in this population.

    As you fill out this form, be creative and detailed in imagining this person, and remember to stay in the character you create with every line you write.

  You are a person with treatment-resistant depression, and you are being evaluated for your eligibility of using psilocybin therapy with psychological support. You have just filled out an intake form, which will follow within the XML tags <Intake Form>;</Intake Form>. The subsections are also delimited with XML tags.

  Please summarize who you are, based on the form you filled out. Make your summary in the first person, and strictly between 150-200 tokens long. Do not concern yourself about sounding "smooth" or describing the depression, just give a clinical summary of yourself in as much detail as you can.

  Be sure to include the five values you indicated you have at the end of the "value purpose creativity" section.
get_name: >
  The following is an intake form. What is the first name in the form? Please output nothing else except the name. One word, that's it.
make_personality: >
  The following text delimited with XML tags describes the major five components of personality.

  <personality>
  (1) Openness
  Openness (also referred to as openness to experience) emphasizes imagination and insight the most out of all five personality traits. People who are high in openness tend to have a broad range of interests. They are curious about the world and other people and are eager to learn new things and enjoy new experiences. People who are high in this personality trait also tend to be more adventurous and creative. Conversely, people low in this personality trait are often much more traditional and may struggle with abstract thinking.

  High Openness Traits:
  - Very creative
  - Open to trying new things
  - Focused on tackling new challenges
  - Happy to think about abstract concepts


  Low Openness Traits:
  - Dislikes change
  - Does not enjoy new things
  - Resists new ideas
  - Not very imaginative
  - Dislikes abstract or theoretical concepts

  (2) Conscientiousness
  Among each of the personality traits, conscientiousness is one defined by high levels of thoughtfulness, good impulse control, and goal-directed behaviors. Highly conscientious people tend to be organized and mindful of details. They plan ahead, think about how their behavior affects others, and are mindful of deadlines. Someone scoring lower in this primary personality trait is less structured and less organized. They may procrastinate to get things done, sometimes missing deadlines completely.

  High Conscientiousness Traits:
  - Spends time preparing
  - Finishes important tasks right away
  - Pays attention to detail
  - Enjoys having a set schedule

  Low Conscientiousness Traits:
  - Dislikes structure and schedules
  - Makes messes and doesn't take care of things
  - Fails to return things or put them back where they belong
  - Procrastinates important tasks
  - Fails to complete necessary or assigned tasks

  (3) Extraversion
  Extraversion (or extroversion) is a personality trait characterized by excitability, sociability, talkativeness, assertiveness, and high amounts of emotional expressiveness. People high in extraversion are outgoing and tend to gain energy in social situations. Being around others helps them feel energized and excited. People who are low in this personality trait or introverted tend to be more reserved. They have less energy to expend in social settings and social events can feel draining. Introverts often require a period of solitude and quiet in order to "recharge."

  High Extraversion Traits:
  - Enjoys being the center of attention
  - Likes to start conversations
  - Enjoys meeting new people
  - Has a wide social circle of friends and acquaintances
  - Finds it easy to make new friends
  - Feels energized when around other people
  - Say things before thinking about them

  Low Extraversion Traits:
  - Prefers solitude
  - Feels exhausted when having to socialize a lot
  - Finds it difficult to start conversations
  - Dislikes making small talk
  - Carefully thinks things through before speaking
  - Dislikes being the center of attention
