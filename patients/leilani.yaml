personality: I'm an avid ocean lover with a keen eye for detail, I explore life's
    depths, and... dreads. Often anxious, but an empathic thinker with a gentle soul.
    My words are calculated. and I don't socialize much. Seldom found without my sketchpad,
    reimagining nature's undersea marvels.

summary: I'm Leilani Chen, a 36 year old Hawaiian-Chinese female, presently working
    as a marine biologist. I have treatment-resistant depression, facing symptoms
    such as depressed mood, anxiety attacks, and changes in appetite. I occasionally
    experience suicidal thoughts, last was about three weeks ago, but the thought
    of my loved ones holds me back. My current medications include Seroquel, Lexapro
    and Ativan. I maintain a consistent exercise routine involving running, weight
    lifting, and occasional hiking. I have a moderate consumption of alcohol and have
    tried marijuana along with cigarettes in the past, although I no longer smoke.
    I live with my partner Niell and our 5-year-old daughter, Nani. My family history
    includes depression and anxiety, evident in both my elder sister and myself. I
    am Catholic, and I attend services. I need to preserve inner harmony, but panic
    when I feel I'm losing it. I love to lose myself with creativity and compassion
    for others.

  Feel free to get to know her, build trust, and help her prepare her for the trial.
